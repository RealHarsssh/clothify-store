# 🌐 Get Your Live Website Link (2 Minutes)

## To get your live website URL, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Go to Vercel
Visit: **https://vercel.com/new**

### Step 2: Deploy Your Project
- **Option A (Easiest):** Drag and drop your entire `clothify-store` folder into the browser
- **Option B:** Sign in with GitHub, then import your repository

### Step 3: Get Your Link
After deployment (takes ~2 minutes), Vercel will give you a link like:
- `https://clothify-store.vercel.app` 
- Or `https://your-project-name.vercel.app`

---

## Alternative: Use This Command
If you have Vercel CLI authenticated, run:
```bash
npx vercel --prod
```

This will give you the deployment URL immediately.

---

**Your project is ready at:** `C:\Users\Harshal\clothify-store`

Once deployed, you'll get a live URL that you can share!
